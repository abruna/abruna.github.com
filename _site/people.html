      <p>Hongsen focuses on developing differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques and in-situ electrochemical FTIR spectroscopy to characterize and evaluate fuel cell and lithium ion battery electrode materials and electrolytes, exploring new electrode materials and improving the efficiency and stability of fuel cells and lithium ion batteries. He is also interested in mechanistic studies of small molecule oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions on Pt based catalysts, which are fuel cell related electrode reactions. Currently he mainly focus on profoundly understanding of CO electrocatalytic oxidation mechanism on Pt binary catalysts in acidic and basic media using in-situ techniques such as DEMS and FTIR , as well as DFT calculation and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In his spare time, he enjoys playing with his kids.</p>

    <p class="description">
      <p>I am a senior undergraduate studying chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, and I am working on a project aimed to develop a biosensor that electrochemically detects avian flu antibodies. Using QCM frequency analysis and electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide produced by antibodies bound to specialized polymer brushes, we can detect trace amounts of antibody in any solution, and by extension in the blood serum of an affected patient. We hope that this platform for antibody detection can be translated into the development of a portable battery-powered microfluidic device that can detect and diagnose avian flu infection in patients living in remote and socioeconomically marginalized parts of the world where laboratories or hospitals are out of reach. I am particularly interested in the medical applications of electrochemistry because I am pre-med and hope to practice and research developmental or reproductive endocrinology as a future doctor. Beyond my research and studies, my passions lie in playing recreational badminton and reading, debating, and writing about political and social issues.</p>

      <p>Gabriel&#8217;s research focuses on the characterization of materials for electrochemical energy storage applications. Specifically, he investigates the electrochemical reactions of conducting polymers, elucidating their reaction mechanisms, studying charge transfer kinetics and developing methodologies to incorporate them in functional devices. On his spare time, he plays intramural sports, enjoys watching profesional sports, and doing outreach activities.</p>

    <p class="description">
      <p>I am a senior undergraduate studying chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, and I am working on a project aimed to develop a biosensor that electrochemically detects avian flu antibodies. Using QCM frequency analysis and electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide produced by antibodies bound to specialized polymer brushes, we can detect trace amounts of antibody in any solution, and by extension in the blood serum of an affected patient. We hope that this platform for antibody detection can be translated into the development of a portable battery-powered microfluidic device that can detect and diagnose avian flu infection in patients living in remote and socioeconomically marginalized parts of the world where laboratories or hospitals are out of reach. I am particularly interested in the medical applications of electrochemistry because I am pre-med and hope to practice and research developmental or reproductive endocrinology as a future doctor. Beyond my research and studies, my passions lie in playing recreational badminton and reading, debating, and writing about political and social issues.</p>

      <p>Yingchao Yu’s research focuses on using advanced electron microscopy techniques (TEM, STEM, EELS, 3-D tomography), especially in-situ methods, for electrochemical energy application. Specifically, the intent is to understand materials properties and reaction mechanisms of fuel cell catalysts and novel Li-ion battery electrode materials, with the intent of enhancing the performance of practical devices. Grown up in China, he is interested to build ‘green-energy’ platforms in the developing world. In the spare time, he loves playing sports and travelling.</p>
