<p>
  <b>The Abruña group performs cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research to address problems of
  electrochemical interest, from fundamental studies of battery and fuel cell systems to molecular
  electronics.</b> We employ standard electrochemical techniques in addition to X-ray methods,
  scanned probe microscopies (STM, SECM), NMR, nanoscale fabrication, electron microscopy 
  (SEM, TEM), DEMS, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques (UV-vis, IR, Raman). Our 
  group also synthesizes novel, tailored inorganic complexes and organic battery materials to drive 
  discovery of new chemical and electrochemical properties.
