The Abruña group has over 20 years of experience in the in-situ and operando investigation of electrochemical interfaces using synchrotron radiation.  These studies have been carried out locally at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS), as well as at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab and the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Lab.  Initial studies probed the underpotential deposition of metals and halogens on single-crystal precious-metal electrodes using x-ray standing waves.  Recently, several battery and fuel cell materials including metal oxides, elemental sulfur, and organic/organosulfur molecules were investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and inelastic X-ray scattering.  By using multiple complementary techniques, deeper insight into the dynamics of the system can be gained.  Future studies will introduce new techniques such as small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray emission spectroscopy to the group's x-ray toolbox.
