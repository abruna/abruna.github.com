An ex-situ location tracking technique is performed for studying catalyst sintering mechanism in three dimensions, revealing the underlying degradation mechanism of be nanoparticle coalescence (Fig.1, Ref 1). With the advances of abreaction-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron energy loss spectroscopic imaging (STEM-EELS), we have also studied many fuel cell oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst including intermetallic Pt-Co (Ref 2), dealloyed Pt-Cu (Ref 3), surfactant-free Pt-Fe (Ref 4-5), core-shell structured Pd-Co (Ref 6-7). This approach is also used to study different Li-sulfur battery materials (Ref 8-11), and silicon anode for Li-ion battery (Ref 12).

In-situ imaging through liquids is a promising approach for exploring electrochemical processes that typically occur in liquid environments.  Recent advances in microfluidic cells for use in STEM have enabled nanometer-scale imaging through liquids in real time (Ref 13). Developments in holder circuitry also provide the groundwork for in-situ electrochemical studies for fuel cell and battery materials (Fig.2). One example of performing in-situ EELS and energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) has enabled the real time imaging the lithiation and delithiation process of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> in a battery full cell (Fig.3).
