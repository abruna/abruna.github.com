Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a scanning probe technique in which an ultramicroelectrode (UME) is poised in proximity of another electrode's surface to obtain information about its reactivity, such as through feedback of a redox mediator in solution between the UME and surface (Figure 1), or to modify the surface.  The UME is attached to stepper motors which allow for adjusting the UME-surface distance or rastering the UME over the surface to obtain an image.  Our Model 900 CH Instruments (Austin, TX) SECM (Figure 2) is used to probe the activity of electrode surfaces including graphene and photocatalysts.  Tips are fabricated using a pipet puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Lab, Tokyo, Japan) (Figure 3) and characterized using an optical microscope.  Recently, our group combined SECM capabilities with scanning DEMS for characterizing electrocatalysts.
