title: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
---
In-situ solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique new to Abru&ntilde;a group. NMR is a non-invasive technique that can be used to probe the local environment of battery materials. The use of 7Li NMR allows for phase changes to be monitored during the electrochemical reaction of a battery material with lithium. In addition to monitoring phase changes, the primary benefit of in-situ studies is the ability to observe metastable phases, as well as gain information about the solid electrolyte interphase, which can be destroyed upon disassembly of the cell. With this information, insight into the conversion or intercalation mechanism can be gained.
