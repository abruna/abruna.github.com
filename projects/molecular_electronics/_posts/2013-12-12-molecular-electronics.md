Molecular electronics applies a "bottom-up" approach to electronic materials, allowing for the study of current flow at small length scales.  Unlike conventional silicon-based computer chips, which have become smaller through "top-down" improvements in the ability to define features using lithography and etching processes, molecular electronics seeks to build functional device elements using molecules, which represent the ultimate limit in the miniaturization of devices.  

Techniques that generate metal-single molecule-metal configurations, including the "sewing machine" and mechanical break-junctions (Figure 1), that our group has developed in collaboration with Prof. Dan Ralph's group in the physics department have enabled us to address fundamental questions concerning the chemistry and physics of molecules.  Much work has been done on the synthesis, characterization, and computational analysis of wires based on transition-metal coordination complexes \[1\] and optical switches using photochromic molecules based on dithienylethene units \[2\].  Additional studies include statistical measurements on single molecule conductance \[3\] and single-molecule transistors \[4,5\].  
  
More recently, our group has focused on investigating the electrochemical properties of single layer, large area graphene \[6\], which is a promising platform for making reproducible contacts with molecules, a challenge using traditional electrode materials such as gold.  In collaboration with Prof. Will Dichtel's group, we have studied the electrochemical properties of redox-active tripodal molecules designed to adsorb to graphene surfaces through non-covalent interactions \[7\].  Using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), we developed a molecule for 2D diffusion by characterizing the surface diffusion of these tripods deposited on graphene (Figure 2) \[8\].  We generated library of redox mediators (Figure 3) that we can use to probe any changes in the electron transfer kinetics of graphene \[9\], such as those induced by mechanical and chemical defects (Figure 4) \[10\].  With these results, we are currently investigating other methods for modifying the charge-transfer properties of graphene at the molecular level.
