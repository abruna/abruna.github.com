title: Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes
---
Over the years there has been meaningful contribution on the development of cationic OH- conducting solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) known as alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEM). These AAEMs use liquid fuels of small organic molecules such as methanol, ethanol, formic acid and others, which is of great advantage due to their higher volumetric and gravimetric energy densities. However, fundamental and extensive analytical studies must be conducted to understand the processes that occur in these membranes in operando. OH- transport, anion exchange dynamics in the membranes, the effect of carbonation and swelling of the polymer upon hydration are some of the fundamental investigations needed to be cultivated in the field.  Ex-situ and in-situ characterization is currently being conducted using different techniques and instrumentation found at our facilities.   Our collaboration with the Coates group has granted us the opportunity to study the most novel and promising AAEMs found in literature.
