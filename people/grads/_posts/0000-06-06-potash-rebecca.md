Rebecca focuses on utilizing a variety of known electroactive materials for electrical energy storage (EES) in new and exciting platforms.  She currently focuses on redox flow batteries (RFB's), an EES device in which the cathode and anode are redox active solutions, the catholye and anolyte respectively. She also studies modified electrodes for pseudocapacitors. When not in the lab she enjoys windsurfing and hiking in the summer, skiing in the winter and glassblowing all year round.
