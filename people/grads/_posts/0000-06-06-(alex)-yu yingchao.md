Yingchao Yu’s research focuses on using advanced electron microscopy techniques (TEM, STEM, EELS, 3-D tomography), especially in-situ methods, for electrochemical energy application. Specifically, the intent is to understand materials properties and reaction mechanisms of fuel cell catalysts and novel Li-ion battery electrode materials, with the intent of enhancing the performance of practical devices. Grown up in China, he is interested to build ‘green-energy’ platforms in the developing world. In the spare time, he loves playing sports and travelling.
