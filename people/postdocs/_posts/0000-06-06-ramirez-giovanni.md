Giovanni's interests range from developing pyrochlore catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and understanding crystallization processes to extend the range of metals and inorganic materials that form pyrochlores and study its reactivity towards oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for applications in energy generation. 

As a further ambition he would like to design micro bio devices to use as sensors for  a quantitative understanding of physiological phenomena through electrochemical methods.
