Jamesâ€™ primary area of interest is the use of inorganic conversion materials as electrodes in lithium ion batteries. More specifically, he is studying the conversion mechanisms of these materials in order to better understand their behavior under operating conditions. To observe these mechanisms, a combination of in situ solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and in operando X-ray techniques is utilized. In his free time, James enjoys playing and watching sports like volleyball, basketball, and football.
