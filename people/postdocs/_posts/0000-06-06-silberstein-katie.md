Katie conducts operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies to analyze molecules, materials, and systems relevant to lithium-ion batteries.  She hopes to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that lead to bulk charge storage within novel materials.  Outside of lab, Katie plays trumpet in the Ithaca Concert Band.
