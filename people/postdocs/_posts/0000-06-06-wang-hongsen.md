Hongsen focuses on developing differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques and in-situ electrochemical FTIR spectroscopy to characterize and evaluate fuel cell and lithium ion battery electrode materials and electrolytes, exploring new electrode materials and improving the efficiency and stability of fuel cells and lithium ion batteries. He is also interested in mechanistic studies of small molecule oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions on Pt based catalysts, which are fuel cell related electrode reactions. Currently he mainly focus on profoundly understanding of CO electrocatalytic oxidation mechanism on Pt binary catalysts in acidic and basic media using in-situ techniques such as DEMS and FTIR , as well as DFT calculation and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. In his spare time, he enjoys playing with his kids.
