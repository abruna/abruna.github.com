Nikki has many interests in the Abru√±a group. Her main project is using scanning probe techniques, namely scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), to investigate charge transfer and molecular transport properties of single layer graphene electrodes. She collaborates with the Brock (Applied Engineering and Physics) group at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) on in situ surface x ray diffraction measurements of catalyst materials. She also collaborate with the Baird (Chemistry and Chemical Biology) and Ober (Chemical Engineering) groups in developing a biosensor for the avian flu. She enjoys working in the machine shop and making small equipment parts.
