My research focuses on the use and development of advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques, especially in-situ methods, for energy applications. Specifically, the intent is to understand materials properties and reaction mechanisms of fuel cell catalysts and novel battery electrode materials, with the intent of enhancing the performance of practical devices.
