Abby's work deals mainly with the study of electrocatalysis with respect to fuel cells. In particular, she studies cathode materials using combinatorial and electrochemical techniques, mainly rotating disk electrode voltammetry (RDE), for characterization and analysis, and a sputtering chamber to grow the combinatorial films of interest. When she's not doing chemistry, she likes to cook, read, and knit.
