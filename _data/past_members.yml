  description: "Giovanni's interests range from developing pyrochlore catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and understanding crystallization processes to extend the range of metals and inorganic materials that form pyrochlores and study its reactivity towards oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for applications in energy generation. As a further ambition he would like to design micro bio devices to use as sensors for a quantitative understanding of physiological phenomena through electrochemical methods."

  description: "Nikki has many interests in the Abruña group. Her main project is using scanning probe techniques, namely scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), to investigate charge transfer and molecular transport properties of single layer graphene electrodes. She collaborates with the Brock (Applied Engineering and Physics) group at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) on in situ surface x ray diffraction measurements of catalyst materials. She also collaborate with the Baird (Chemistry and Chemical Biology) and Ober (Chemical Engineering) groups in developing a biosensor for the avian flu. She enjoys working in the machine shop and making small equipment parts."

  description: "I am a senior undergraduate studying chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, and I am working on a project aimed to develop a biosensor that electrochemically detects avian flu antibodies. Using QCM frequency analysis and electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide produced by antibodies bound to specialized polymer brushes, we can detect trace amounts of antibody in any solution, and by extension in the blood serum of an affected patient. We hope that this platform for antibody detection can be translated into the development of a portable battery-powered microfluidic device that can detect and diagnose avian flu infection in patients living in remote and socioeconomically marginalized parts of the world where laboratories or hospitals are out of reach. I am particularly interested in the medical applications of electrochemistry because I am pre-med and hope to practice and research developmental or reproductive endocrinology as a future doctor. Beyond my research and studies, my passions lie in playing recreational badminton and reading, debating, and writing about political and social issues."
