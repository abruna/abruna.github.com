  description: "Ronaldo is from Brazil, where he obtained his PhD in Inorganic Chemistry at the University of São Paulo working with nanocomposites and sensors development. After that, he dedicated five years to a nanotech startup company that helped to create. At Abruña's lab his work is focused on the study of adsorption of probe molecules on graphene and graphene oxide using Raman and spectroelectrochemistry in order to understand the reactivity of these materials and the interaction with other species. In his free time, he likes to listen music and read, mostly about emerging technologies, economy and politics."
