  description: "Kenny works on a systematic study of different families of Organic Molecules (OM) as cathode materials for energy storage applications. The study consist of two steps: computational screening/designing of new OM and electrochemical characterization. He uses computational chemistry to predict the formal potentials and identify the most promising candidates before the synthesis and characterization (using electrochemical techniques) of the selected molecules. As a personal detail Kenny enjoys dancing latin music specially salsa."
