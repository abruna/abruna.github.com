  description: "Kenny works on a systematic study of different families of Organic Molecules (OM) as cathode materials for energy storage applications. The study consist of two steps: computational screening/designing of new OM and electrochemical characterization. He uses computational chemistry to predict the formal potentials and identify the most promising candidates before the synthesis and characterization (using electrochemical techniques) of the selected molecules. As a personal detail Kenny enjoys dancing latin music specially salsa."

  description: "Rebecca focuses on utilizing a variety of known electroactive materials for electrical energy storage (EES) in new and exciting platforms.  She currently focuses on redox flow batteries (RFB's), an EES device in which the cathode and anode are redox active solutions, the catholye and anolyte respectively. She also studies modified electrodes for pseudocapacitors. When not in the lab she enjoys windsurfing and hiking in the summer, skiing in the winter and glassblowing all year round."

  description: "James’ primary area of interest is the use of inorganic conversion materials as electrodes in lithium ion batteries. More specifically, he is studying the conversion mechanisms of these materials in order to better understand their behavior under operating conditions. To observe these mechanisms, a combination of in situ solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and in operando X-ray techniques is utilized. In his free time, James enjoys playing and watching sports like volleyball, basketball, and football."
